Note to instructors:

Update, PollInput, Draw and other crucial starting methods. Take care to instruct in an 
almost hands off approach, guiding them on what should be done but now how. Push them to
use online researching techniques to acquire the necessary information on how to achieve 
each of the lower level tasks.
